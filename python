""" Imagine you are working on a project that requires calculating the last digit of a Fibonacci number at a specific position. Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1.



Your task is to create a program that efficiently calculates the last digit of the Fibonacci number at the nth position.



Function Signature: fiboLastDigit(n)

Input format :
The input consists of a single non-negative integer n, representing the position.

Output format :
The output prints the last digit of the Fibonacci number at the nth position."""

def fiboLastDigit(n):
    if n <= 1:
        print(n)
    else:
        a, b = 0, 1
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, (a + b) % 10
        print(b)

n = int(input())
